      <description>Client: I can enter my first name, middle name and last name fine in iPhone 7, but in iPhone 5S the last name text field is covered by keyboad, why this is happening? One of the oldest and basic problem of using UITextField in iOS. If you are making a form or adding multiple UI components in one page for your iOS application, its pretty much normal that the bottom UITextFields could be covered by your keyboard.</description>

      <description>Location services is a powerful feature of iOS, but sometimes its not easy to understand all the API&amp;rsquo;s and learn how to use them. With BBLocationManager, you can start using iOS Location Services API in no time. It provides good code documentation for better understanding of the methods and delegates. If you are making a location aware app or building a geofencing app like the Alarm app in iOS which reminds you to buy milk when you are near home, BBLocationManager can be your choice.</description>

      <title>Synchronus Code Execution in iOS</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Asynchronus programming&amp;rdquo; is a polular term now-a-days. People are talking all over the internet about it. Specially when we have network/API calls, we should keep free the main thread, and do the network calling stuff in the background. Cause if we block the main thread, it won&amp;rsquo;t be able to respond to user interaction such as touch. Async calls can be executed on new/seperate threads synchronously, or can be scheduled in the main/other thread&amp;rsquo;s runloop.</description>
