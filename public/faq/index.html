<h2 id="some-frequently-asked-questions">Some Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>What is difference between Cross platform development vs Native App development?</h3>
<p>Cross-platform technology provides a framework where one source-code can be utilized to create the multi-platform application; mainly for iOS & Android.</p>
<p>With native app development, we use default language and IDE for both iOS and Android, i.e. Objective-C/Swift with xCode for iOS and JAVA with Android studio for Android.</p>
</div>

<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>Should we support iPad version for iOS and tablet version for Android?</h3>
<p>Almost all the iOS / Android application working on the iPad / Tablet; but if you have any specific requirement, budget & market base then you can get the separate application developed for iPad / Tablet.</p>
<p>Mostly the business users or executives are finding it handy to have the iPad / Tablet version while they want to represent something in meeting because of size. If your application represent those users then I will suggest to have separate version.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>What will happen to my app with new OS releases in both iOS and Android?</h3>
<p>Generally iOS & Android do take care of the old functions so that your application does not stop working when there is new OS released but still your complete application or certain part of the application stopped working then you should create the list and contact the development company to get them fixed.</p>
<p>Development company may fix the specific issue or have to recode the specific part; as that is completely dependent on how deeply new OS affect the old application.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>How can I make my app successful?</h3>
<p>To make the application a success - you must have to review again with what purpose you got the application developed?, Do you have solid marketing strategies for the users you are targeting?, Do you have enough funding to manage the solid marketing?</p>
<p>If you have above answers then based on the answers you can prepare the action plan and reach to the end-users.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>I have my unique app idea - How can I share it with you to make sure it is secured?</h3>
<p>We do sign NDA</span> to make sure your idea is secured and not spread anywhere else except working team.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>I am non technical person who wants to build an app. How can you help me?</h3>
<p><span class="highlited-pinktxt">We do have worked with many non-technical clients</span> in past and we are helping them from all the aspects to have the properly designed product.</p>
<p>You can share each drop in your mind with our Techno-Commercial sales person; they will suggest you from technical perspective and even what approach we should proceed with; for the best output.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>What would be the payment policy?</h3>
<p>We divide complete project in few milestones; so whenever we finish milestone; we send it for client approval. On approval of specific milestone; client has to release the payment defined for that milestone.</p>
<p>This way client do not have to pay big amount together. They see the progress - get satisfied and pay for that portion.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>Will I need to test my app fully?</h3>
<p>We have the testing team in-house and before submitting to client we test the things to make sure everything is upto the mark.</p>
<p>But we always encourage our clients to test from their own perspective so that when application go live at that moment they have complete idea of what is happening.</p>
<p>Most of the applications are having Admin Panel also which later on manage by client or their team so we request them to go through everything before making the things live.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>Would you help us to set up server?</h3>
<p>Yes, we will set up basic server and deploy files on your server to make the system live.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>Would you take care of submission of application in app store or would I need to take care of that part?</h3>
<p>Yes, that would be our free service and part of our contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>How would you take care of data security?</h3>
<p>There are many loopholes in the application from where application can get hacked. To make our developed application more secure - we use below things:</p>
<ol>
<li>To make the data transmission secure we are using authentication token system so that input/output is do not get hacked.</li>
<li>For making the data storage secured we encrypt the sensitive data.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>How frequently I would get updates?</h3>

<h3>Would I need to talk with your entire team during project development stage?</h3>

<p>The project leader will secure all the communication happened in between you; in the document and send you for your confirmation; on your approval; he will pass to team.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
<h3>Should I have website with all features same as application?</h3>
<p>There are many application which are not having identical websites so it is not mandatory to have website with same features as application.</p>
<p>Again you can check - If your concepts required and users are demanding it then you can go with website same as your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="list-group-item">
