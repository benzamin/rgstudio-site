<h3>What is difference between Cross platform development vs Native App development?</h3>
<p>Cross-platform technology provides a framework where one source-code can be utilized to create the multi-platform application; mainly for iOS & Android.</p>
<p>With native app development, we use default language and IDE for both iOS and Android, i.e. Objective-C/Swift with xCode for iOS and JAVA with Android studio for Android.</p>

<h3>Should we support iPad version for iOS and tablet version for Android?</h3>
<p>Almost all the iOS / Android application working on the iPad / Tablet; but if you have any specific requirement, budget & market base then you can get the separate application developed for iPad / Tablet.</p>
<p>Mostly the business users or executives are finding it handy to have the iPad / Tablet version while they want to represent something in meeting because of size. If your application represent those users then I will suggest to have separate version.</p>

<h3>What will happen to my app with new OS releases in both iOS and Android?</h3>
<p>Generally iOS & Android do take care of the old functions so that your application does not stop working when there is new OS released but still your complete application or certain part of the application stopped working then you should create the list and contact the development company to get them fixed.</p>
<p>Development company may fix the specific issue or have to recode the specific part; as that is completely dependent on how deeply new OS affect the old application.</p>
